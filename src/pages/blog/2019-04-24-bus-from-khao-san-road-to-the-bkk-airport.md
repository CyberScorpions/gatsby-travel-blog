# Getting to BKK Airport 

While staying near the Khao San road we were looking for a way to get 

Staying at other areas of the city has several options like the Bangkok Metro you can find on Google maps but looking at the options around Khao San road yield only the more expensive options like:

* Normal taxi - About 400-500 Baht 
* Grab taxi - About 300 Baht (Metered) - This is the local "Uber", you can download the app [here ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&hl=en)
* Mini van - About 150 Baht (Per person) - You can ask your hotel/hostel how to get those

This is probably the cheapest way to travel to the Bangkok airport, A ticket to will cost 60 Baht (updated 2019) 

The bus number is S1, it has several stops around the old city area and specifically the Khao San road. 



although many do not know it and it is quite hard to find info on Google maps etc.
